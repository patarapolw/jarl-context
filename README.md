# Japanese Real-life Context Sentences

Focusing on accuracy and manual editing.

## Manual editing

They are mainly at `/my-edit/*/*/override.yaml`.

Not only cleaning up, but I also adding phrases as I go.

## Tags and choices

I added `tags: [silent, name, place]`. Are they qualified vocabularies? Are they helpful? It might depend on what you wanted.

Also, pronunciation of names is another issue. How would they be added?

## My chosen sentences

I also pull out my data from Anki (via AnkiConnect). I will also add it, as it may be helpful in the future.
